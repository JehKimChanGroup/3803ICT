● The primary dataset that we would like to use is the job market dataset
which is provided in CSV format (data.csv). You can try to crawl new
data from seek.com.au yourself but it is optional.

● Perform data preparation and preprocessing for your analysis.

● Submit your Jupyter notebook in your Github repository.
1) Describe the dataset.
  For example:
  ○ What are the categories/domains of the dataset?
  ○ What is the dataset size of each variation?
  ○ What is dataset structure/format?
  ○ What are attributes/features of data you are going to use?
  ○ Which parts of the dataset will you use or all of them?
  [1-2 paragraphs, 2 points]

  ○ How do you load the data using Pandas?
  ○ How do you normalize the data?
  ○ How do you clean the data?
