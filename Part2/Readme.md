Part 2 – Data Analysis and Interpretation [10 points]
● Perform exploratory data analysis.
● Perform statistical data analysis.
● Perform predictive data analysis.
● Submit your Jupyter notebook in your Github repository.

1) Study the job metadata. Extract the relevant information to describe the job’s attributes.
  For example:
  ○ What is the sector, sub-sector of each job?
  ○ Where is the location of the job?
  ○ Which is the range of salaries for each job?
  [1-2 paragraphs, 2 points]
2) Study the market by locations.
  For example:
  ○ What is the market size in each city? Which are the hottest job sectors in each city?
  ○ Which range of salary is common in each city? Where are the employees more well-paid?
  ○ Can you detect the pattern of posting: e.g., are more jobs posted at the beginning of the month?
  [1-2 paragraphs, 3 points]
3) Study the market by sectors.
  For example:
  ○ Which sectors keep the highest market share?
  ○ In each sector, which sub-sectors are the main spotlights?
  ○ What is the salary range for each sector/sub-sector? Can you compare the salary range between sectors/subsectors?
  ○ What is the trending of the market, i.e., if a high school student asks you which subject should he/she learn in the university (to guarantee a job in the future), what is your advice?
  ○ Can you detect which skills are required in each sector?
  [1-2 paragraphs, 3 points]
4) Visualize the results on an interactive visualization (web page, plotly, etc.)
  For example:
  ○ Trend analysis: visualize the number of jobs by locations, sectors, etc.
  ○ Compare between locations or sectors about the number of jobs, the salary, etc.
  ○ Present the necessary skills by sectors, by subsectors.
